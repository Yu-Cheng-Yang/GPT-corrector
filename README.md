Setting up the GPT-corrector

To run the GPT-corrector, follow these steps:

Apply your own OPENAI API key as an environment variable in your development environment under the name 'OPENAI_API_KEY'. This key is necessary to interact with the OpenAI API.
Install Streamlit, the framework used for running the GPT-corrector, as well as python-docx. You can install it by running the following command:

pip install streamlit python-docx

Run Streamlit in your Python terminal. Navigate to the project folder and execute the following command:

streamlit run main.py

If the project is not in your current directory, provide the full path to the 'main.py' file when running the command.
